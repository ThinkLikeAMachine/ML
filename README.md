### Machine Learning Project - Predict star ratings

Objective of this project is to predict a new venue's popularity from information available when the venue opens. Machine learning algorisms were built from a dataset of venue popularities provided by Yelp. The dataset contains meta data about the venue (where it is located, the type of food served, etc.) and the star ratings.

Simple models were first developed based on single features, i.e. location (neighborhood), category (type of the business), attributes (e.g. appointment needed or not). An ensembled model was also built to combine the estimators and showed significantly improved performance (score close to 0.82).

*The original project assignment was created by Pragmatic Institute, but modified and fulfilled by Hanyu Yangcheng.
